Modelling Anesthesia
================================

In the practice of pharmacology, models of drugs effect are usually separated into two sub-categories: pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD). The PK model describes the time evolution of the drug concentration in the body after an injection, and the PD model describe the effect of a given drug concentration on a physiological variable. On top of that, non-linear interaction between the different modelling can be considered to improve the simulation accuracy or modelled events such as blood-loss.
